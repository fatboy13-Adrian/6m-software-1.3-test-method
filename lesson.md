## Brief

### Lesson Overview

We will be spending the first hour to learn about software testings, and next 2 hours creating tests for simple JavaScript applications. 

> Note for instructors
> - Run all `.js` files with `node` in the Terminal.
> - While running JS code, use debugging terminal to visually guide learners how codes are executed.

## Part 1 - Software Development Life Cycle

1. *Requirement* Analysis - Gathering the business and technical requirements.
2. *Defining* - Defining the functional and non-functional requirements.
3. *Designing* - Translating the functional requirements into workable tasks.
4. *Coding* - Writing code a.k.a. development phase.
5. *Testing* - Ensuring the outcome of development aligns with the defined requirements.
6. *Deployment* - Going live into production.
7. *Maintenance* - Monitoring systems health and fix errors when arises.

## Part 2 - Software Testing Methods

### Functional Testings

1. *Unit Test* - An isolation testing targeting at the smallest piece of logic in the software.
2. *Integration Test* - Testing multiple software modules together as a group.
3. *Acceptance Test* - Testing the functionality of the software by end users before launch.

### Non-functional Testings

1. *Performance Test* - A non functional test to determine the stability, speed, responsiveness and resilience of the system.
    1. Load Test - Simulate an increasing amount of traffics/requests sent to the system.
    2. Stress Test - Determine the peak load and/or how much requests the system can receive.
    3. Endurance Test - Determine the behaviour of the system at the peak load over time.
2. *Security Test* -
    1. Dependency Vulnerabilities - Scanning for vulnerabilities introduced by dependencies.
    2. Secrets & Data Storage Strategy - Determine how secure are secrets and sensitive data being stored.

## Part 3 - Group Discussion

Different industries apply the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in various ways, depending on their specific needs and requirements. Here is an example of how an industry approaches the SDLC stages:

### Finance and Banking
 - *Planning*: Rigorous planning is crucial due to strict regulatory compliance and security requirements. Detailed documentation and approvals are necessary.
- *Requirements Gathering*: Close collaboration with business stakeholders and legal teams to capture complex financial rules and regulations.
- *Design*: Emphasis on secure system architecture, data encryption, and access controls.
- *Development*: Adherence to coding standards and best practices for financial applications, such as OWASP guidelines.
- *Testing*: Extensive testing, including security testing, penetration testing, and stress testing, to ensure system robustness and data integrity.
- *Deployment*: Careful planning for data migration, user training, and compliance with regulatory bodies.
- *Maintenance*: Continuous monitoring for security vulnerabilities, regulatory changes, and system performance.

Understanding Part 1 and Part 2, learners will be grouped in a team of 3 or 4 to research (google), discuss how an industry approaches the SDLC stages. Learners may simple use google docs for this.

Here are the industries per group:
1. Group 1 - eCommerce
1. Group 2 - Healthcare
1. Group 3 - eLearning
1. Group 4 - Social Media

## Part 4 - Testing using Jest

### Setup

In order for us to test out our codes, we can use a testing package and write our own tests. In JavaScript, we can use `jest` as our test package. To install Jest in our local machines, we use the command `npm install -g jest`, this installs Jest globally so that other projects can use it.

### Writing tests

Jest can be used to write tests for JS applications. To write a test, the file must end with the `.test.js` extension.

A test suite is a collection of tests that can be done for the specific test file. 

To create a test suite, the `describe` keyword is used.
```js
describe("description of the test suite", () => {
    //tests to be written
})
```

Let's create a test file called `simple_test.test.js`.
```js
//simple_test.test.js
const {addFunc, isDivisbleBy5} = require("./sample");

describe("Test Suite for sample.js functions", ()=>{
    
})
```
The `require` allows the test file to use the `addFunc` and `isDivisbleBy5` functions that we exported from our `sample.js` file. You can take a look at the `sample.js` file to see how the functions were exported.

After the test suite has been created, individual tests are written using the `it` keyword.

```js
it("test description", () => {
    //test itself
})
```

Tests typically are done wherein a function is called with necessary parameters and then compared with a specific result. 

In order to achieve this, the `expect` keyword is the value to be tested and `toBe` the expected value.

```js
//simple_test.test.js
const {addFunc, isDivisbleBy5} = require("./sample");

describe("Test Suite for sample.js functions", ()=>{
    
    it("should add 3 numbers", ()=>{
        const result = addFunc(1, 3, 4);
        expect(result).toBe(7);
    })

    it("should check divisibility by 5", ()=>{
        const result = isDivisbleBy5(1283);
        expect(result).toBe(false);
    })
})
```

There are other keywords that can be used to test such as `toBeCalledTimes` for loops. The documentation is very helpful for us to check how to compare values.

### Running tests

To run tests, go to the folder where the test is located and run the command: `npm run test`.

After the test is run, the result would show which test would pass or fail.

<img src="./assets/failed-unit-test-2.PNG">

Rewrite the test that failed and run the test command again and see how the tests pass this time.

### Test-Driven Development
One of the Agile methodologies is *Test Driven Development*. The concept behind it is that tests are written for all the functionalities of the application first before any actual coding will take place. 

After the tests have been written, code now will be written to pass the tests.

This way, developers know that the functionality works before pushing the code into repositories.

In the assignment folder, a sample test file called `demo.test.js` has been created that would test the code for `q2-arrays-loops.js` and `q3-objects.js`. This would simulate the part of TDD where the test have been written and it would fail when run.

For the assignment, the students will have to write the code to make the tests pass in `demo.test.js` to complete the TDD cycle.
